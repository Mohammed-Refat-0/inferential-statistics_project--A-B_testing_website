# Data science project
## A/B testing on a website
### introduction
For this project, I worked to generate and analyze the results of an A/B test for an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.  I helped the company decide if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. the project is written using Python and several of its statistical libraries.
